# IoT-Smart-Waste-Management-System
Real-time bin level detection using Raspberry Pi Pico for urban waste management.

Scope:
To design and implement an IoT-based smart waste monitoring system that automatically measures bin fullness, provides LED/Buzzer alerts, sends cloud updates via Wi-Fi, and optionally pushes notifications to users. The system improves waste collection efficiency through real-time monitoring, remote data logging, and intelligent alerting.
